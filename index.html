    <p>
      My name is You Young, and I like programming, traveling foreign lands, learning new languages, rock climbing, and playing video games.
      <br></br>
      I am open minded and always love to learn new things, so don't hesitate to reach out if you would like to get in touch and be my buddy!
    </p>

    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>
      I am a software engineer with Master's degree in Electrical & Computer engineering, working at Georgia Tech Research Institute.
      <br> </br>
      As a software engineer, I am experienced in signal processing algorithm design and optimization, Full-Stack application development for hardware simulation tools, Python library development to help users easily design their own FPGA architectures, and Computer Vision projects with Machine Learning applications. 
      <br> </br>
      During my college years in Georgia Tech, the primary concentration of my study was DSP - I researched in the topic of Music & Sound Signal Processing and assisted in developing cutomized Machine Learning algorithms in order to detect the desired source of signal(s) from music or speech signal.
      <br> </br>
      I started my career as DSP & FPGA engineer working in military application industry - my role as DSP & FPGA engineer was developing Linux_ARM <-> FPGA embedded architecture, programming parallel FPGA logics to achieve high-speed and reliable computations, and designing various DSP software and algorithms - in my days brainstorming and optimizing DSP algorithms, I found my passion from the fields of algorithm developments with Data Science applications and research.
      <br> </br>
      As I have found my career passion in Data Science and research, I am currently pursuing MS degree in Computer Science and looking for research experience in relevant fields.
